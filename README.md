### 1. What are the healthiest cities for Black Americans?
<p>2020 has redefined health for many Black Americans. Using data from the CDC Places data project and American Community Survey data, what are the health prevention profiles of 500 of America's largest cities? How does this profile look for cities that have a sizable share or population of Black people? This python script ("COVID_Black_Census.ipynb") pulls census data for approximately 29,000 places (city, state) and their associated FIPS codes from the 2019 5 year ACS to join with the CDC Places data at the place/state (city, state) FIPS level.
